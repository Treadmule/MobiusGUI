					<p>If you find Mobius GUI useful and you think it saved you some time, you may consider buying me a coffe using the paypal donation button you find at the bottom of the page. Your donation will help me keeping the app up to date with every next Mobius camera firmware release.</p>
					<p>I am not affiliated with the makers of the Mobius camera, I simply am a Mac user who wanted to have some sort of interface to change settings on his Mobius instead of having to fiddle with a .txt file all the time.</p>
					<p>If you don't know what a Mobius action camera is, I suggest you take a look at <a href="http://www.techmoan.com/blog/2013/7/8/the-mobius-camera-the-do-it-all-mount-anywhere-1080p-micro-c.html">Mat's review</a> on <a href="http://www.techmoan.com">Techmoan.com</a></p>
