					<p>This web application is in it's uttermost early stage... That means, if something doesn't work it's definitely my fault. I'm trying to update things as often as I can and as quickly as possible, but </p>
					<p>At the moment, only firmware versions 0.59 and 1.13 are supported. I plan to support every next firmware release, but don't plan to support versions older than 0.59.</p>
					<p>This app works best with Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox. Internet Explorer is not tested and therefore (probably) unsupported, I do not intend to support it in the future.
					<p>Apple's Safari works just fine, but doesn't allow to automatically download the generated file, so you will simply have to hit &#8984;+S to save it and name it "SYSCFG.TXT"</p>
