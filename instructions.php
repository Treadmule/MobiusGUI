					<p>This web application is in it's uttermost early stage... That means, if something doesn't work it's definitely my fault. I'm trying to update things as often as I can and as quickly as possible.</p>
					<p>At the moment, the only supported firmware versions 0are .59 and 1.13. My plan is to support every next firmware release, but do not plan supporting versions older than 0.59.</p>
					<p>This app works best with Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox. Internet Explorer is not tested and therefore unsupported, I do not intend to support it in the future.</p>
					<p>However if you are a Windows user you might prefer configuring your Mobius camera using the native Windows application you can find on <a href="http://www.mytempfiles.info/mobius/">Isoprop's website</a>.
